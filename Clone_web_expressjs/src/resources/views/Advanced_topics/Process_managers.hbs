  <p>When you run Express apps for production, it is helpful to use a
    <em>process manager</em>
    to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Restart the app automatically if it crashes.</li>
    <li>Gain insights into runtime performance and resource consumption.</li>
    <li>Modify settings dynamically to improve performance.</li>
    <li>Control clustering.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A process manager is somewhat like an application server: it’s a
    “container” for applications that facilitates deployment, provides high
    availability, and enables you to manage the application at runtime.</p>
  <p>The most popular process managers for Express and other Node.js
    applications are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong><a
          href="https://nodemon.io"
          target="_blank"
        >Nodemon</a></strong>: Monitor for any changes in your source and
      automatically restart your server.</li>
    <li><strong><a
          href="https://github.com/Unitech/pm2"
          target="_blank"
        >PM2</a></strong>: A production process manager for Node.js applications
      that has a built-in load balancer. PM2 enables you to keep applications
      alive forever, reloads them without downtime, helps you to manage
      application logging, monitoring, and clustering.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="http://strong-pm.io/">StrongLoop Process Manager
          (Strong-PM)</a></strong>: A production process manager for Node.js
      applications with built-in load balancing, monitoring, and multi-host
      deployment. Includes a CLI to build, package, and deploy Node.js
      applications to a local or remote system.</li>
    <li><strong>SystemD</strong>: The default process manager on modern Linux
      distributions, that makes it simple to run a Node application as a
      service. For more information, see
      <a
        href="https://www.axllent.org/docs/view/nodejs-service-with-systemd/"
