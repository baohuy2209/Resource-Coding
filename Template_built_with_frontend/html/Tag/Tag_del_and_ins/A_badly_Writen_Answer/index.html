      Explain how financial intermediation exposes banks to risk and explain
      what those risks are.
    </i>
    <br /><br />
    Financial <del>intermission</del> <ins>intermediation</ins>involves asset
    transformation <del>wherepie</del> whereby intermediares mismatch the
    liabilities owed and assets owned in terms of duration, size and liquidity.
    This mismatch leads to the intermediary facing several types of risk:
    interest rate risk, <del>market risk</del>, credit risk and liquidity risk.
    Two other risks faced by a bank <ins>are</ins>market risk and operational
    risk but these simply result from trading
    <ins>and operating</ins>.<br />Interest rate risk has two effects: the
    market effect and the income effect. Only the income effect results
    <ins>from</ins>financial intermediation, which is further broken down into
    two scenarios: the assets of a bank having a greater duration than its
    <del>assets</del> <ins>liabilities</ins>or the the liabilities of a bank
    having a greater duration than its assets. The former results in
    <del>repotato-ing risk</del> reinvestment risk which is the risk that assets
    (loans) may be re-invested at a rate <del>higher</del> <ins>lower</ins>than
    existing liabilities (deposits). The latter results in refinancing risk
    which is just the opposite.<br />Credit risk is the risk that a
    <del>loan</del> borrower defaults and that none <ins>or only a part</ins>of
    the banks liabilities are recouped.<br />Liquidity risk is the risk arising
    from a mismatch in <del>socks</del> <ins>duration</ins>. It is the risk that
    a bank is not able to liquidify its assets in time to pay its liabilities
    and <del>will definetely</del> may default.
