    <h1>My summer vacation</h1>

    <p>
      This summer I went to Camp Smurfabunch. I was there for 2 weeks and had
      mega fun times. I was the fastest kayaker in the whole camp and won a
      first place ribbon. I learned to tie knots, dive off a pier, and lick
      toads.

      I met new friends Ketchel, Caleb, and Sarah. I hope they come visit me
      later this summer but even if they can't &mdash; I'll see them next
      summer.

      Later that summer I got to go to Wisconsin Dells with my family. We stayed
      at The Wilderness which has both inside and outside water parks. My mom
      was scared to go down the four-person funnel ride, but she did anyway and
      ended up liking it.

      We went go karting at Mt. Zues (or something, I can't remember the name
      but there was an old god dude holding a lightning bolt as the logo). I
      beat my brother and dad on the first 2 laps but dad pulled ahead and beat
      me on the last lap.

      The last thing I did this summer was go shopping for school clothes and
      supplies. I got a Trapper Keeper with KISS on it. And like fifty erasers
      because I make mistakes a lot lololol.

      I don't want to go back to school but I know once I get used to it, it
      will be fine again. I'd rather just go down waterslides all day.
